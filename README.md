❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Unbeatable)
📌 Project Overview
This project implements an AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player competes against an intelligent AI agent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm (with optional Alpha-Beta Pruning) to make optimal decisions, ensuring that it never loses.
The project introduces core concepts of game theory, decision-making, and search algorithms in Artificial Intelligence.
🎯 Objectives
Understand game-playing AI concepts
Implement the Minimax algorithm
Learn optimal decision-making strategies
Explore search algorithms and recursion
Build an unbeatable AI opponent
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Minimax Algorithm
Alpha-Beta Pruning (optional)
Recursion
Game Theory Concepts
⚙️ How It Works
The game board is represented as a 3×3 grid
The human player makes the first or second move
The AI evaluates all possible future moves using Minimax
The AI selects the move with the best possible outcome
The game continues until a win, loss, or draw
